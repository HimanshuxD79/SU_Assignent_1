## **Audio Spectrogram Analysis with Different Windowing Techniques**

This project explores various windowing techniques for audio signal processing and spectrogram generation using the UrbanSound8K dataset. The implementation includes comparative analysis of different windowing methods, spectrogram visualization, and a neural network classifier for audio classification.

# Dataset
